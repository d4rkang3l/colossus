Colossus uses the (currently nameless) metrics library.

## Introduction

High-throughput Colossus services can serve hundreds of thousands of requests
per second, which can easily translate to millions of recordable events per
second.  The Metrics library provides a way to work with metrics with as little
overhead as possible. It is configurable via a [typesafe config](https://github.com/typesafehub/config).
See [reference config](https://github.com/tumblr/colossus/blob/master/colossus-metrics/src/main/resources/reference.conf)

### Collection Intervals

Collection intervals define how often the raw data from all event collectors
are snapshotted and merged together into a single database of values.

The provided config creates a metric system with both 1 second and 1 minute
collection intervals.  The 1 second interval is used to show
real-time metrics where rates and histograms are all showing values reflective
of the last second of activity, whereas the 1 minute intervals are used for
reporting values to an external database in which case the values reported are
all reflective of the last minute of activity.

### Metric Addresses and Tags

Every metric has a url-like address used to identify it.  

One of the most important aspects of metrics is that values can be tagged.  For
example, a rate can track hits to API endpoints, using a "endpoint" tag to break
down the usage by endpoint.

{% highlight scala %}

val rate = Rate("my-rate")
rate.hit(Map("endpoint" -> "foo"))
rate.hit(Map("endpoint" -> "bar"))
rate.hit(Map("endpoint" -> "bar"))

{% endhighlight %}

This will in turn lead to

| endpoint | value |
|----------|-------|
| foo      | 1     |
| bar      | 2     |


## Getting Started

If you are using colossus, it depends on the metrics library and pulls it in.
Otherwise you must add the following to your build.sbt/Build.scala

{% highlight scala %}

libraryDependencies += "com.tumblr" %% "colossus-metrics" % "{{ site.latest_version }}"

{% endhighlight %}

From there, the only required step is to spin up a `MetricSystem`

{% highlight scala %}

import akka.actor._
import metrics._

implicit val actorSystem = ActorSystem()

//create the metric system from a typesafe config
implicit val metricSystem = MetricSystem(MetricSystemConfig.load("application"))

val rate = Rate("my-rate")

rate.hit()

{% endhighlight %}

### Namespaces

When creating a new collector, you always need an implicit `MetricNamespace` in
scope.  The `MetricSystem` itself acts as the root namespace, but you can use it
to create sub-namespaces:

{% highlight scala %}
val metricSystem = MetricSystem()

implicit val namespace = metricSystem / "foo" / "bar"

//this rate will have the address "/foo/bar/baz"
val rate = Rate("baz")

{% endhighlight %}


## Available Collectors

All collectors are thread-safe.

### Counter

A counter simply allows you to set, increment, and decrement values:

{% highlight scala %}

val counter = Counter("my-counter")

counter.set(Map("foo" -> "bar"), 2)

counter.increment(Map("foo" -> "bar"))

{% endhighlight %}


### Rate

A rate is like a counter, but resets at the beginning of each collection
interval.  Rates are also tracked for every interval.

{% highlight scala %}

val rate = Rate("my-rate")

rate.hit()

{% endhighlight %}



### Histogram

Histograms can gather statistical data about values added to them.  By default,
histograms are setup with log-scale buckets, best for recording latency, but
this can be overridden.


{% highlight scala %}

val hist = Histogram("my-histogram", percentiles = List(0.5, 0.99, 0.999))

hist.add(12)
hist.add(1)
hist.add(98765)

{% endhighlight %}


## Metric Reporting

Metric reporters are used to take the periodically generated snapshots of
metrics and report them to an external system.  A `MetricSender` is the
interface to the remote system and is responsible for properly formatting
metrics and handling all communication.  Colossus currently has native support
for OpenTSDB.

{% highlight scala %}

import akka.actor._
import colossus.metrics._
import scala.concurrent.duration._


implicit val system = ActorSystem()
implicit val metrics = MetricSystem(MetricSystemConfig.load("application"))

val reporterConfig = MetricReporterConfig(
  metricSenders = Seq(OpenTsdbSender("host", 123)),
  filters = MetricReporterFilter.All
)

//A reporter must be attached to a specific collection interval.  
metrics.collectionIntervals.get(1.minute).foreach(_.report(reporterConfig))

//now once per minute the value of this rate and any other metrics will be reported
val rate = Rate("myrate")

{% endhighlight %}
